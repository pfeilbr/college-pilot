# College Pilot — Tour · Compare · Decide

A data-driven PWA for narrowing a college list to one: a full campus-visit
guide per school, a financial-aid estimator with divorced-parent handling, a
side-by-side comparison table, and a Decision Board that turns tour-day
ratings into a ranked shortlist.

## Architecture (data-driven by design)

```
index.html        hub (Decision Board, Aid Estimator, cards, compare)
school.html       empty shell — renders any school from its data file
app.js            renderer + shared UI (drawer, ratings, spy, tooltips)
styles.css        the whole design system (per-school color via --sc)
data/<id>.js      one authored guide per school  ← add schools here
data/generated/   machine-fetched official stats  ← refresh via script
scripts/          deterministic data fetchers (no LLM needed)
```

Each `data/<id>.js` registers `window.SCHOOLS['<id>']` with: identity/colors,
hero stats, hub-card fields, contact links, and a `sections` array of
`{id, nav, kicker, title, lead, html}` — the renderer builds the page and
navigation from whatever sections exist, so schools can differ freely.

### Adding a school

1. Add its IPEDS UnitID to `scripts/fetch_school_data.py` (find IDs at
   nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator) and run the script — official stats land in
   `data/generated/scorecard.json` deterministically, no AI tokens needed.
2. Copy an existing `data/*.js` as a template; fill in the editorial sections
   using the generated stats + the school's official pages.
3. Add the id to `window.SCHOOL_ORDER` (in `data/delaware.js`), add a
   `<script>` tag in both HTML files and `sw.js`'s asset list, and add a row
   to the Aid Estimator `DATA` array in `index.html`.

### Refreshing stats (deterministic, free)

```sh
python3 scripts/fetch_school_data.py            # DEMO_KEY, rate-limited
API_KEY=... python3 scripts/fetch_school_data.py  # free key from api.data.gov
```

Pulls acceptance rate, SAT bands, enrollment, demographics, tuition, net price
by income bracket, debt, graduation/retention, and 10-year earnings from the
U.S. Dept. of Education College Scorecard API for every school in the list.

## Feature roadmap (researched against Niche, BigFuture, Scoir, Corsava, CollegeVine, Naviance)

- Weighted scoring matrix with sliders (re-rank live as priorities change)
- Corsava-style preference card sort (Must Have / Nice / Don't Care / No Way)
  that seeds the matrix weights
- Reach/target/safety badges + Naviance-style scattergram from stored GPA/SAT
  vs. each school's middle-50%
- Head-to-head elimination rounds with recorded "why" lines
- Visit-day journal with photos; student vs. parent dual gut-scores
- Deadline countdown board; printable decision report export
